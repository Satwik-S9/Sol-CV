# Drowsiness and Emotion Detection

## Setup Environments

  1. Setup a virtual environment using your tool of choiyolov5/ce `(venv, conda, pyenv)`.
  2. Use the Following command to install the neccesarry packages.

    ```bash
      pip -r requirements.txt
    ```
  
  3. Install Pytorch from the official website `https://pytorch.org/`.

## QuickStart

  1. Use [this](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Train-Custom-Data#11-create-datasetyaml) link to create and overwrite the custom dataset.
  2. run `bash train.sh` to start training (**Note:** This script will clone the [`yolov5`](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) repository from the master branch automatically.)
  3. The Dataset can be self generated by following [these](#generating-dataset)
  4. See the results in `yolov5/runs/train`

## Generating Dataset
  
  1. Run `python collect.py` to capture images of different emotions.
     1. **Note:** This script will capture images of you every 5 seconds to and save it to `data/images` (Make the folder beforehand)
